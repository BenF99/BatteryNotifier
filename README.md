Ever find yourself leaving your phone in another room while it charges? I did, and I wanted an efficient way to be notified when it’s time to unplug. That’s why I created this handy Android app. It sends a text to whoever I’m with, alerting me to unplug my phone when it reaches a desired battery percentage. Now, I can ensure my phone is always charged optimally without constantly checking on it.

Admittedly, this might be the most specific use case ever, and I might be the only one to use it—but hey, it works!
